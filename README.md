# Tripster Rentals

Tripster Rentals is a simple Java-based car rental management system built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It allows customers to view available cars, rent them, and return them, while keeping track of rental history and availability — all in the console.

Features:
View Available Cars — Lists all cars currently available for rent.
Rent a Car — Allows customers to book a car by entering its ID.
Return a Car — Marks the rented car as returned and available again.
Rental History — Tracks and displays customer rental details during the session.
Exit System — Ends the session safely.


OOP Concepts Used
Classes and Objects — To represent Cars, Customers, and the Rental Service.
Encapsulation — Data hiding using private fields and public methods.
Constructors — For initializing objects.
Collections — Using Java's ArrayList to store data in memory.
